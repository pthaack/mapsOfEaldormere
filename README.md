# mapsOfEaldormere
The Kingdom of Ealdormere, a Kingdom of the SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism), a Middle Ages historical recreation group! We hold all kinds of tournaments, feasts, dances classes and more!
<br />The KML files attached are the map files that I have used to upload to Google Maps to visually locate baronial and local borders for the groups that represent our great kingdom.
<br />The PHP files attached are the server side scripts that I have used to build the Event Site Database.  On my to-do-list is integrating the KML data to assign where the venues lies in which local group.
